# Bluetooth-controled-car

As part of an exercise in self-learning, I decided to design and build a remote control car. The system was to be composed of two major components; the remote control unit and the vehicle. I decided to use Arduino Nanos and HC-05 bluetooth modules for both components. The parts list was as follows:

1. 2 x Arduino Nanos
2. 2 x HC-05 bluetooth modules - DSD TECH HC-05 Classic Bluetooth 2.0 Serial Wireless BT Module for Arduino UNO R3 Nano Pro Mini MEGA (Basic Version);
3. 1 x set of motors/wheels - KeeYees L298N Motor Drive Controller Board Stepper Motor Control Module Dual H-Bridge with DC Motor and Smart Car Wheel Compatible        with Arduino.
4. 1 x castor wheel (2-1/2 inches from the ground to the underside of the platform)
5. 2 x USB to TTL adapter shields - Gikfun FT232RL 3.3V 5V FTDI USB to TTL Serial Adapter Module for Arduino Mini Port (Pack of 2pcs) AE1186x2;
6. 1 x 6v voltage regulator
7. 1 x 2-axis joystick
8. 2 x red led lights
9. 2 x 220 ohm resistors
10. 2 x 1k ohm resistors
11. 2 x 2k ohm resistors
12. assortment of wires
13. 2 x BB830 breadboards
14. 4 x 18650 3.7v rechargable batteries
15. 2 x 2x18650 battery cases
16. 1 x homemade platform
17. 1 x 3d printed "axle" to mount the wheels onto the platform

All the code is provided for both components. Note, the file functions.ino must be in the same folder as BT_basic_slave.ino. 
All the STL files for 3d printed components are included as .stl. Note, the bed.stl item was sized to make the bed level with the particular castoring wheel used (2-12 inches from ground to underside of the platform.
